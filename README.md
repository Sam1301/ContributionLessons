# Things I learnt from Open Source contribution
Recently I started contributing to Zulip Android App. The following is a list of things I am learning everyday as being part of the community.

1) Always try to have a positive cheerful mindset, and help people as much as possible. This removes any feeling of bad competition that you might have.

2) No matter how difficult it is to solve a bug/work on an enhancement , the solution to your problem exists :)

With the knowledge of innternet at your tips, you can literally learn anything.

3) Mentors are AWESOME, they are always there to help you :)

But you gotta become an awesome student to ask for help. Search your problem as much as you can. When you are CONVINCED, that the solution to your problem requires a knowlegde of the history of the project or something that you haven't seen anywhere EVER, then ASK :)
Sometimes it can be hard to judge exactly when to ask. For that here's an awesome blog post https://blogs.akamai.com/2013/10/you-must-try-and-then-you-must-ask.html

4) Use git

Recently, I switched from Android Studio GUI git, to terminal git. Its gives you much power!!!

5) Explain your approach to solve a particular problem. 

That really shows how you think.

6) Solve bugs

I think solving bugs is really a nice way to acquaint yourself with the codebase.

7) Never be afraid to express your own ideas

Sometimes, you really feel passionate about implementing your own new feature. You are willing to go to lengths for it.

8) Try to exceed expectations, because its fun to do so :D

9) It won't feel hard work if you really like what you are doing

### Advanced Tips

1) Use the project git history to look at how others solved a similr problem.


And thes most important, try to find something which you LIKE.

Keep Experimenting ;)
