# Contribution Lessons
The following is a comprehensive list of lessons I am learning through Open source contribution.

1) Always try to have a positive cheerful mindset, and help people as much as possible. This removes any feeling of bad competition that you might have.

2) No matter how difficult it is to solve an error, the solution to your proplem exists :)
JUST DON'T QUIT.

3) Mentors are AWESOME, they are always there to help you :)
But you gotta become an awesome student to ask for help. Search your problem as much as you can. When you are CONVINCED, that the solution to your problem requires a knowlegde of the history of the project or something that you haven't seen anywhere EVER, then ASK :)
Sometimes it can be hard to judge exactly when to ask. For that here's an awesome blog post https://blogs.akamai.com/2013/10/you-must-try-and-then-you-must-ask.html

4) Use git
Recently, I switched from Android Studio GUI git, to terminal git. Its gives you much power!!!

4) Try to exceed expectations, because its fun to do so :D

Lastly, take all this with a grain of salt. These lessons help me, maybe they won't work for you.

Keep Experimenting
